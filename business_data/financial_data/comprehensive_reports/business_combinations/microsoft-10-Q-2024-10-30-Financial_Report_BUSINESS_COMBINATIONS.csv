BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,"NOTE 7 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS Activision Blizzard, Inc. On October 13, 2023 , we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”) for a total purchase price of $ 75.4 billion, consisting primarily of cash. Activision Blizzard is a leader in game development and an interactive entertainment content publisher. The acquisition will accelerate the growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming. The financial results of Activision Blizzard have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Activision Blizzard is reported as part of our More Personal Computing segment. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was completed as of September 30, 2024. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have allocated the purchase price were as follows:
(In millions)
Cash and cash equivalents $ 12,976
Goodwill 51,001
Intangible assets 21,969
Other assets 2,503
Long-term debt ( 2,799 )
Long-term income taxes ( 1,946 )
Deferred income taxes ( 4,676 )
Other liabilities ( 3,620 )
Total purchase price $ 75,408
Goodwill was assigned to our More Personal Computing segment. The goodwill was primarily attributed to increased synergies that are expected to be achieved from the integration of Activision Blizzard. Substantially all of the goodwill is expected to be non-deductible for income tax purposes. Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:
(In millions, except average life) Amount Weighted Average Life
Marketing-related $ 11,619 24 years
