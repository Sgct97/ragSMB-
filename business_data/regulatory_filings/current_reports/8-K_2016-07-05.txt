without a meeting if the action is taken by all the members of the Board or all the members of the committee. The action must be evidenced by one or more consents describing the action to be taken, given by all directors or all members of the

in the U.S. mail if mailed with first-class postage to the address as it appears on the current records of the Corporation; (c)&nbsp;on the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and the

shareholders or directors in an electronic transmission shall be effective only with respect to shareholders and directors that have consented, in the form of a record, to receive electronically transmitted notices and that have designated in the
consent the address, location, or system to which these notices may be electronically transmitted and with respect to a notice that otherwise complies with any other requirements of the WBCA and any applicable federal law. A shareholder or director
who has consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices may revoke this consent by delivering a revocation to the Corporation in the form of a record. The consent of any shareholder or director is revoked if (a)&nbsp;the Corporation is
unable to electronically transmit two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with the consent, and (b)&nbsp;this inability becomes known to the Secretary, the transfer agent, or any other person responsible for giving the notice.
The inadvertent failure by the Corporation to treat this inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting or other action. </P>
