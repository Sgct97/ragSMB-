# Local RAG Pipeline for Business Documents

This project is a step-by-step guide to building a completely local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The goal is to create a system that can answer questions about a private set of documents, running entirely on a local machine without reliance on external APIs.

## Project Phases

1.  **Foundation & Data Sourcing:** Setting up the environment and acquiring realistic business documents.
2.  **Ingestion Pipeline:** Loading, chunking, embedding, and storing the document content in a vector database.
3.  **Query Pipeline:** Setting up a local LLM and building the retrieval and answer-generation logic.
4.  **Interface & Evaluation:** Creating a user-friendly interface and discussing methods to evaluate the pipeline's performance.
